        Most people keep asking themselves why Lorem Ipsum is used instead of
        real English text. The most obvious reason is that designers realized
        that when it comes to judging a certain design, focusing on the
        appearance is more important than understanding the idea. So, actual
        purpose for Lorem Ipsum boils down to focus. That is, itâ€™s always a
        proven fact that if someone looks at a design with a real copy, they
        would easily get distracted as they would try to focus on what the text
        means instead of the design.
